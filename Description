Java program that plays the following board game. Two players take turns putting colored tiles on a rectangular gameboard of size R × C, where R is the number of rows and C is the number of columns. The goal is for a player to place a pre-specified number k of their tiles in adjacent positions of the same row, column, or diagonal of the board, similarly as in the game of tic tac toe. However, some positions on the board are marked as ”blocked” and player tiles cannot be placed there.
The first player who places k of their tiles in adjacent positions of the same row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If no more empty positions remain on the board where player tiles can be placed and no player has won, then the game ends in a draw.
Your program will play against a human opponent. The human player uses light blue tiles and the computer uses orange tiles. Empty positions on the board are green and blocked positions are dark blue. The computer randomly decides who makes the first move.
